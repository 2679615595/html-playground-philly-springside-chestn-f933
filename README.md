# HTML Playground

## Instructions

You know that really popular blogging platform where people post cat gifs? Wouldn't it be cool to see how that works?

In this lab, you'll be filling in your own HTML elements and attributes to modify a Tumblr-like website.

## What is HTML?

HTML is a markdown language that allows you to render whatever you want on a webpage. Think of each element as a holder for what you want on the page, whether it's text, images, gifs (which are actually images, but obviously better), and videos.

Every HTML element is expressed with and start and end tag, with the content you want displayed on your website in-between them. Let's say I wanted a headline on the top of my page. I would use the `<h1>` element and write:

`<h1>My Favorite GIFs</h1>`

### The Format of every HTML webpage...

#### ...looks like this:

```
<html>
<head>
  <title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

Everything on your page should be surrounded by `<html></html>` tags. The `<head></head>` tags encapsulate information about the page, like what type of language it is, and which stylesheets and other files we would like to include (more on that later). In-between

## Some helpful HTML elements




## Note

Don't worry if this don't fully make sense. It's a playground space for you to explore some HTML and render your fave gifs on a page. We're going to go more into detail on what's happening after this lab.

Have fun! :)
